abstract = {The Shor's algorithm can find solutions to the discrete logarithm problem on binary elliptic curves in polynomial time. A major challenge in implementing Shor's algorithm is the overhead of representing and performing arithmetic on binary elliptic curves using quantum circuits. Multiplication of binary fields is one of the critical operations in the context of elliptic curve arithmetic, and it is especially costly in the quantum setting. Our goal in this paper is to optimize quantum multiplication in the binary field. In the past, efforts to optimize quantum multiplication have centred on reducing the Toffoli gate count or qubits required. However, despite the fact that circuit depth is an important metric for indicating the performance of a quantum circuit, previous studies have lacked sufficient consideration for reducing circuit depth. Our approach to optimizing quantum multiplication differs from previous work in that we aim at reducing the Toffoli depth and full depth. To optimize quantum multiplication, we adopt the Karatsuba multiplication method which is based on the divide-and-conquer approach. In summary, we present an optimized quantum multiplication that has a Toffoli depth of one. Additionally, the full depth of the quantum circuit is also reduced thanks to our Toffoli depth optimization strategy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we evaluate its performance using various metrics such as the qubit count, quantum gates, and circuit depth, as well as the qubits-depth product. These metrics provide insight into the resource requirements and complexity of the method. Our work achieves the lowest Toffoli depth, full depth, and the best trade-off performance for quantum multiplication. Further, our multiplication is more effective when not used in stand-alone cases. We show this effectiveness by using our multiplication to the Itoh-Tsujii algorithm-based inversion ofF(x8+x4+x3+x+1).},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">We have entered the age of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. However, these devices are not fault-tolerant to run the traditional quantum algorithms (like Shor's or Grover's Algorithm) for doing computation on a useful scale. In this dissertation work, we examine the potential of NISQ era quantum optimization, such as quantum annealing implemented for the Ising model and the gate-model quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), for solving problems in linear algebra. This is especially relevant as many of the other quantum algorithms (such as the Harrow Hassidim Lloyd algorithm) for linear algebra have a list of assumptions that may not be addressed in the near-term future. The discrete quantum optimization approach is an alternative to those techniques that while not being as fast as the more traditional quantum algorithms for linear algebra, may still perform better than the conventional classical techniques in the near-term and beyond.We start with a study of quantum annealing for solving linear least squares problems. Here, we show how quantum annealing can be faster than some of the most prominent direct (classical) methods, given certain assumptions. Our adiabatic simulations give an indication that quantum computing can have an advantage for problems where matrix (Formula Presented) has dimensions (Formula Presented) and also where A may be ill-conditioned. We followed it up with experiments on least squares problems and compared it to the best classical results.Next, we take a look at a few different ways in which post-processing results from quantum optimizers with classical techniques can impact the quality of the solution. We consider the single-qubit correction (SQC) and the multi-qubit correction (MQC) techniques, two promising techniques and study their effectiveness for the domain of linear algebra. In our work, we found SQC performs much better than MQC for domains where the problem graphs are densely connected, such as in linear algebra. In this context, we can think of numerical iterative techniques such as least squares MINRES (LSMR) for linear least squares and bi-conjugate gradient (BiCG) for linear systems of equations as highly effective domain specific post-processing techniques. When using the outputs from D-wave and SQC as the initial guess x_0 for these techniques (instead of an all-zero vector), we found an improvement in a majority of the cases. This improvement was measured in terms of the number of iterations for reaching the termination condition and/or the absolute error in the residual b-Ax for a fixed number of iterations. This implies that a hybrid quantum-classical iterative solver may provide advantages against a purely classical one.And finally, we worked on applying and studying QAOA for binary linear least squares (BLLS), a problem that can serve as a building block for other hard problems in linear algebra. Our experiments were done on the QISKIT simulator and two IBM Q 5 qubit machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work done on applying BLLS on a gate-model quantum computer. We highlight the possibilities of using QAOA and QAOA-like variational algorithms for solving such problems, where the outputs produced are classical, unlike the other gate model algorithms that produce amplitude encoded results. Our simulations indicate that QAOA can scale well with problem size for good approximate solutions but getting an optimal solution is more challenging. We show how Simulated Annealing can outperform QAOA for BLLS at a circuit depth of (Formula Presented) for the probability of sampling the ground state. Finally, we point out some of the challenges involved in current-day experimental implementations of this technique on a cloud-based gate-model quantum computer.

abstract = {In the context of the development of quantum technology, most asymmetric encryption algorithms managed to be broken using Shor's algorithm, while symmetric encryption algorithms, such as AES-256, are believed to be unbroken for the moment, Grover's algorithm has been able only to reduce AES brute force attack time to its square root. This paper proposes to present how Quantum technology can affect current security algorithms and analyze how it can be used to improve our data protection by developing new algorithms. Quantum cryptography alongside Quantum key distribution could be a deal-breaker by using new encryption algorithms and providing new solutions to different cryptographic tasks that are known to be impossible by using normal computers. In the end, it will be discussed how the concept of quantum teleportation could provide new, faster, and much more secure solutions in telecommunication compared with the ones based on radio technologies.},
