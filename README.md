# QIS-Articles
### In this document, I linked some interesting articles about quantum information scienc.

ðŸ’¬ : I found these articles in my university's database and they revolve mainly around Shor's algorithm and different ways to use it.

I used both Latex and Zotero ( for the references ) in this project.
